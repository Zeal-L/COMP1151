1.
    When MutexGuard goes out of scope, it automatically releases the lock. This ensures that no lock release operation is missed anywhere in the program, thus avoiding potential contention conditions.

2.
    Rust prevents protected values from being extracted from MutexGuard at compile time

    This is because MutexGuard ownership rules are encoded in the compile-time checker and the compiler disallows dereferencing of MutexGuard references.
