This repository contains all of the assignments and lab exercises and exams and slides for all of the computer electives I completed at UNSW.

I hope that it will serve as a reference for future students who may find it inspiring.

**Please make sure to never copy my code directly, it will only result in you being punished by the university and then failing the course!**
