Webster's phone is the observer, and the ticket issuer is the publisher.
The ticket issuer adds Webster to the observer list.
When the ticket is opened, Webster will be reminded, which is equivalent to calling the update method in the observer.


When Webster is notified by the ticket issuer, it is a push for the ticket issuer.
