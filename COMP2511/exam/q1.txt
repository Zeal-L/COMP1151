A:
i. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling their respective hashCode() methods must produce the same integer result.
Here it did not rebuild the hashCode method, there may be errors

and it should also add a check for getClass()

ii. assertEquals(new Article(something).equals(new Article(somethingdiff)));

B:

i. After the List calls the remove() method, the element at the index position will be removed, and all the elements after the index will be moved to the left in turn. So the list will be destroyed

ii. assertEquals(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9), withoutOddNumbers(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)));
