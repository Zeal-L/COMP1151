A:
Now there is duplicate code, the difference is just a constant.
Moreover, the cohesion force is low and the coupling degree is high.
The specific setPosition algorithm can be written into their respective classes. Then simulate just loops through all Satellite's Update Position methods.

B:
Too many parameters.
Consider designing more class structures. Then just pass those instances around.
For example, willTimeout and timeout and metrics can be merged into one class. Consumer and tracer and topics can also be merged into one class.
