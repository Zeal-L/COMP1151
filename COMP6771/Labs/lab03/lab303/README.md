# 303: Statistically Marking

In `src/marks.txt` there is a newline separated file of anonymous marks from a previous offering of this course!
To show off your budding C++ prowess, you have decided to calculate the median, average, highest, and lowest mark from this newline-separated list using nothing but the C++ Standard Library. In particular:
- std::ifstream
- std::ofstream
- std::vector
- std::algorithms

In your enthusiasm, you decided to code your program in a modular style. So, in addition to a `calculate_stats()` function, you also made a separate function that loads in the marks from a file!

In reflection, you remembered your old Professor's words, and decided to write at least **two** tests overall to make sure your code is correct.

Both functions should be coded in `src/stats.cpp`, but more documentation is in `src/stats.h`. Your tests should be implemented in `src/stats.test.cpp`.

You should check with your tutor to make sure your budding C++ prowess is still aligning with modern C++ style guidelines.
