# 301: Plug-and-Play STL

There are many ready-made components in the STL that make common programming tasks extremely easy.
When it comes to using containers like `std::vector` and algorithms like `std::sort`, many useful things can be found in the `<functional>` header.

Your task is to complete the `sort_descending()` function in `src/sort_descending.cpp`.
You can find its documentation in `src/sort_descending.h`.

You also need to write at least **two** tests in `src/sort_descending.test.cpp` to make sure your code is correct!
