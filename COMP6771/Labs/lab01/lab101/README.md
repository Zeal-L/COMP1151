# 101: Hello, world!

Every journey must begin with a single step.

The proverbial "first step" for programmers learning a new language is to write the basic "Hello world" program from [_The C Programming Language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).
You too shall partake in this great tradition.

In `src/hello.cpp`, write the `main()` function such that it can be run as so:
```shell
$ ./hello
$ Hello, world!
$ (next command)
```
