# 107: Gotta Sort It Out

Write a function, called `sort3` in `src/sort3.cpp`, which takes three `int` references and sorts
them in ascending order.

Then, write **two** test cases in `test/sort3_test.cpp` to confirm that `sort3` is correct.

You should then write an overload for `sort3` so that it also sorts three `std::string` references. Don't forget to write at least **two** more test cases!
