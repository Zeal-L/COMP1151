# 206: Is It a Perumutation?

The purpose of this exercise is to get experience using different parts of the C++ Standard Library's helpful types and data structures.

In `src/permutation.h`, there is documentation for a function that, given two strings, determines if one string is a permutation of the other. In this instance, a string `s1` is a permuation of another string `s2` if:
- `s1` and `s2` contain the same number of letters
- `s2` contains all of the letters of `s1`, but not necessarily in the same order.
- The empty string is a permutation of itself.

You need to implement this function in `src/permutation.cpp` and write at least **two** tests in `src/permutation.test.cpp`.
