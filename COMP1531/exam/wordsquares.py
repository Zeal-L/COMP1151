        A word square is a square of n n-letter words are arranged in a grid so that they read the same from left to right and from top to bottom. The following are examples of word squares:
    T O E     B A B Y    F R I L L   R E A C T S
    O N E     A R E A    R O D E O   E X P O R T
    E E L     B E E R    I D E A S   A P P E A R
              Y A R D    L E A P S   C O E R C E
                         L O S S Y   T R A C T S
                                     S T R E S S
    In wordsquares.py, write a function wordsquare(words) that is given a list of words. You can assume that all of these words are upper case and are all of the same length (at least 3 and no more than 6). You will need to produce a single word square, one that uses the largest number of different letters of all word squares obtained from the word list. If there are multiple squares with the same number of different letters, any one will do.
    If there is no solution, your function should return 'No solution'.
    For example:
    wordsquare(['LAST', 'OPUS', 'CATS', 'DOGS', 'POST', 'STOP', 'NEXT', 'PIGS', 'TYPO', 'COWS'])
        ==
        ['STOP',
        'TYPO',
        'OPUS',
        'POST'
        ]
    """
    return 'No solution'
