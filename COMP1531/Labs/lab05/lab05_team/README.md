## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?

I think the biggest challenge is some of the detailed parts of the code, I need to help people to change a lot of bugs, these errors are easy to appear. There is also the problem of our inconsistent style, which needs to be modified in the last part of the project in a uniform way, and it also takes a lot of time.

2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?

I think it's all pretty good, and our group communicates very quickly.
